# Dataproject Taylor Rule

In this short project we use the Taylor rule in its original from 1993 to calculate the optimal central bank interest rate for USA and the Eurozone in the period 2000-2018. The result is compared graphically to actual interest rate for the same period. With the same data we then estimate the coefficients of the Taylor using OLS, and use the estimates to calculate a new central bank interest rate using the Taylor rule and compare it graphically to actual interest rate.
